The goal of this task is to implement a Python framework enabling the development and
execution of Python coded agents in a Shared Minecraft server. The agent should be able to
move, interact with the environment, build and destroy blocks, and send or receive messages
from the chat.
Create examples like InsultBot (insulting in the chat and bothering users), TNTBot (an agent
deploying TNT and exploding it) or an OracleBot (answering questions in the chat using a list of
answers or a LLM like ChatGPT).
Demonstrate the use of funcional programming in Python with different examples.
Demonstrate the use of reflective programming in Python with different examples.
Create a github repository including documentation, examples and unit tests.
Include a github badge (github actions) demonstrating the code coverage of the code in your
repository.
